Roadmap 
=======

List of features needed for 1.0 release:

* Stable option names
* Stable API
* Complete documentation
* A french version of the documentation
* Drop redundant/useless features:
  * support for including highlight.js (if syntect can work nicely on Win)
  * ?

Not really blocking (can happen after 1.0 without being breaking):

* Real support for ODT
* Download external images and embed them
